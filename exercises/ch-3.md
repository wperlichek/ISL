### Conceptual 

1. 

__Describe the null hypotheses to which the p-values given in Table 3.4
correspond. Explain what conclusions you can draw based on these
p-values. Your explanation should be phrased in terms of sales, TV,
radio, and newspaper, rather than in terms of the coefficients of the
linear model.__

Conclusion: The data shows it is highly unlikely that devoting money towards TV or Radio will NOT lead
to an increase in sales. For newspaper, the data is inconclusive. If we want to make more sales, advertising in either TV or Radio will help us. Until we analyze the data more, 
we should choose either TV or Radio but not both, as we don't understand their relationship when together yet. If we need to make a decision on TV vs Radio, the data suggests that radio will have a stronger increase in sales.

Intercept p-value: Very low, reject the null hypothesis that there is not a base, default amount of sales irrespective of advertising

TV p-value: Very low, reject the null hypothesis that increasing TV advertising does not lead to increase in sales

radio p-value: Very low, reject the null hyptothesis that increasing radio advertising does not lead to increase in sales

newspaper p-value: Very high, fail to accept the null hypothesis, increasing just newspaper sales does not increase sales


Analysis: 
- NEVER "accept" the null hypothesis. We "fail to reject" it. 
- My thinking about the coefficients is shallow - just because one has a higher coefficient than the other, it does not mean that's where surely the money should go. If the budgets 
AKA units of both were same, then that would be true. If they were closer, we'd need 
to consider their ranges, but in the case here they are so close that we can pretty confidently
choose the one with the highest coefficient.
- Interaction effect is valid but be careful when answering the question. You can model TV vs others by holding them constant and still get answer for "should we spend on both" if they are not run simultaneuosly and thus not subject to the interaction effect. That being said, 
it seems the data shown presumed that it was an additive effect and no interaction.

2. Carefully explain the differences between KNN classifier and KNN regression methods.

KNN classifer: We classify some qualitative predictor by checking K neighbors next to it. 
               The neighbor which has the most count is what our predictor is classified as.

KNN regression: We try to fit a non-linear model by using KNN regression which has less
                innate bias than normal linear regression. A non-parametric method.
                We find where f(x) lands and then take the average of the K neighbors 
                around it, that becomes the estimate for f(x) in KNN. 

Key differences: 
    - KNN classifier doesn't use an average of the K neighbors, KNN regression does
    - KNN regression is quantitative - we're trying to model the function

Analysis:
    - Pretty much correct. Obvious addition: classifer vs regression problem, each has own use


**3a**

x1 = GPA

x2 = IQ

X3 = Level (1 for college, 0 for high school)

x4 = Interaction between GPA and IQ 

x5 = Interaction between GPA and Level

Response = starting salary after graduation (in thousands of dollars)

Suppose we use least squares to fit the model, and get:

b0 = 50 (intercept)

b1 = 20 (GPA)

b2 = .07 (IQ)

b3 = 35 (Level)

b4 = .01 (IQ and GPA)

b5 = -10 (GPA and Level)

$\hat{f}(x) = 50 + 20x_1 + 0.07x_2 + 35x_3 + 0.01(x_1 \cdot x_2) - 10(x_1 \cdot x_3)$

Where the variables are interpreted as:

* $x_1$: GPA
* $x_2$: IQ
* $x_3$: Education Level (0 = High School, 1 = College)
* $(x_1 \cdot x_2)$: Interaction between GPA and IQ
* $(x_1 \cdot x_3)$: Interaction between GPA and Education Level


Analysis of the function behavior: 
- Everyone has a default 
starting salary of 50 no matter if they went to college or not.

- You get a small boost to your starting salary the higher the product of your GPA and IQ is (small boost, it's not significant compared to other factors).

- Generally, IQ has a positive impact on your starting salary. 

- If you did not go to college, you are not subject a GPA penalty that college grads have. College grads actually have a small decrease in starting salary 
that scales with their GPA, higher GPA = greater decrease in starting salary,
which is puzzling

- However, college grads get the biggest boost to their income potential too. This invididual predictor (not considering any other interaction effects) is the single strongest predictor of starting salary 

- GPA, too, is a strong predictor of starting salary - this is true if you went to college or not. Even more, high school students with a high GPA don't get punished by the interaction effect by GPA and education level like college students do, so high school students in particular should try to get a high GPA if they want a good starting salary out of high school.

True or false: For a fixed value of IQ and GPA, high school graduates earn
more, on average, than college graduates?

ANSWER: FALSE

RATIONALE: The high school grad needs to have a very high GPA and then they will make more

True of false: For a fixed value of IQ and GPA, college graduates earn
more, on average, than high school graduates.

ANSWER: FALSE

RATIONALE:  This is an absolute statement. We know for high GPAs this isn't true. This must be false.

True of false: For a fixed value of IQ and GPA, high school graduates earn
more, on average, than college graduates provided that the
GPA is high enough.

ANSWER: TRUE

RATIONALE: Proof by opposite of below

True or false: For a fixed value of IQ and GPA, college graduates earn
more, on average, than high school graduates provided that
the GPA is high enough.

ANSWER: FALSE

RATIONALE: A college graduate who has a really high GPA could lose to a high school grad with a very high GPA because the high school grad would get all the benefit of x1 without the penalty of the interaction effect. 


**3b**

Predict the salary of a college graduate with IQ of 110 and a
GPA of 4.0.

Answer:

50 + 20(4.0) + .07(110) + 35(1) + .01 (4.0 * 110) - 10 (4.0 * 1) = ~137


**3c**

False. It doesn't mean that there is no evidence for the effect, it just means thats the effect itself is small. We would need to look at the p-value to examine the evidence for this interaction event, AKA what is the chance we would see this interaction event by random chance. If less than some threshold, then we reject the null hypothesis that there is no interaction effet between GPA and IQ. 


**4a**

n = 100 observations 
1 predictor, 1 response

Y = b0 + b1x + b2x^2 + b3x^3 + E

Suppose true relationship is linear.

Would we expect the RSS for the linear regression and also the RSS for the cubic regression. 

Question: Would we expect one to be lower than the other, would be expect them to be the same, or is there not enough info to tell? Justify your answer.

Answer: 

        On the training set:

            Cubic regression: 
            We expect the cubic regression model to be flexible and adapt to the observations. However, with only 100 observations, it might not be enough
            for the flexible cubic regression to adhere to the linear model. To be confident that the cubic regression could fit, we need a lot higher observations.

            Linear regression: 
            If the true relationship is linear, then the linear regression will perform well. It will not suffer the bias penalty it will have on 
            non-linear models and thus in only 100 observations should closely match the true relationship. 
            
        1 predictor and 1 response is a simple setup. It gives us hope that the cubic regression might actually perform better than we think. 
        Still, _linear regression in 100 observations should have a lower RSS than the cubic regression_ because it won't suffer from a bias 
        or variance penalty. The cubic regression will be "catching up" while the linear regression will be fine-tuning the model and possibly
        approaching the true relationship quicker in 100 observations. 
        
        It's close... It could largely depend on the data. E.g. if the data patterns are consistent (standard deviation is low) then perhaps the cubic regression
        could be about the same as the linear regression. Still, the cubic regression has to overcome making a non-linear function linear... it will always have that
        hurdle...

**4b**

On test data, we expect the linear regression to have a lower RSS. The cubic regression could have mastered the training set in 100 observations, but it shows high variance - if presented with test data that say has outliers, it will perform much more poorly than the linear regression and have a higher RSS.

**4c**

If the true relationship is not linear, but we don't know how far, it's hard to say, there is not enough information to tell. 
Practically we could start with a linear regression and see how it performs. If it performs poorly, we switch to the cubic regression. 

A linear model has a default bias that is a penalty on any non-linear model. With 100 observations, the cubic regression would probably
perform better (have a lower RSS) than the linear regression.

**4d**

I would expect the cubic regression to perform better than the linear regression on test data. 
It will have adhered to the non-linear model better and suffer from less bias. 
The linear regression could have not even made much progress on the model after 100 observations if the model is non-linear enough, whereas 100 
training observations could produce good progress for the cubic regression. 


**4-Analysis**

**4a** WRONG. For the TRAINING set, the more flexible model will have an RSS <= less flexible model. The non-linear model can simply set coefficients to 0 if it needs and also it could find non-zero values for some coefficients (it has more) that allow it to fit the set better.

**4b** Correct

**4c** Correct

**4d** Not nuanced enough. The correct answer depends on degree on non-linearity. If the non-linearity is small, the linear model will win because the cubic model will have
        higher variance from the training set. The linear models bias would not hurt as much as the variance. Conversely, if the non-linear model is highly non-linear
        the bias penalty will be too great for the linear model. So it depends. This is about the bias-variance tradeoff.

5. Consider the fitted values that result from performing linear regression without an intercept. In this setting, the *i*-th fitted value takes the form
$$
\hat{y}_i = x_i \hat{\beta},
$$
where
$$
\hat{\beta} = \left( \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i y_i \right) \bigg/ \left( \sum_{i'=1}^{n} x_{i'}^2 \right). \quad (3.38)
$$
Show that we can write
$$
\hat{y}_i = \sum_{i'=1}^{n} a_{i'} y_{i'}.
$$
What is $a_{i'}$?

*Note: We interpret this result by saying that the fitted values from linear regression are linear combinations of the response values.*

#### 1. Model Definition

The analysis starts with the model for linear regression without an intercept, where the fitted value `ŷ_i` is a direct product of the predictor `x_i` and the estimated coefficient `B_hat`.

* **Fitted Value (`ŷ_i`):**
    ```
    ŷ_i = x_i * B̂
    ```

* **Estimated Coefficient (`B̂`):**
    ```
    B̂ = (Σᵢ xᵢyᵢ) / (Σᵢ xᵢ²)
    ```

---

#### 2. Numerical Example

A specific example with `n=3` data points `(1,2), (2,3), (3,4)` was used to calculate `B̂`.

* **Calculate the sum of `xᵢyᵢ`:**
    ```
    Σᵢ xᵢyᵢ = (1 * 2) + (2 * 3) + (3 * 4)
           = 2 + 6 + 12
           = 20
    ```

* **Calculate the sum of `xᵢ²`:**
    ```
    Σᵢ xᵢ² = 1² + 2² + 3²
           = 1 + 4 + 9
           = 14
    ```

* **Solve for `B̂`:**
    ```
    B̂ = 20 / 14 ≈ 1.43
    ```

---

#### 3. Calculating a Fitted Value

Using the calculated `B̂`, a fitted value was predicted for a given `x`.

* **For `x = 4`:**
    ```
    ŷ = (4) * (1.43)
    ŷ = 5.72
    ```

---

#### 4. Exploring the General Form

The final part of the notes connects this process to the problem's goal: showing that the fitted value `ŷ_i` is a linear combination of the response values `yᵢ'`.

* **Target Form:**
    ```
    ŷᵢ = Σᵢ' aᵢ'yᵢ'
    ```
* **Question:** What is `aᵢ'`?

$$
a_{i'} = \frac{x_i x_{i'}}{\sum_{k=1}^{n} x_k^2}
$$

Of course. Here is a summary of the key takeaways from a linear algebra perspective.

### Summary: The Linear Algebra of Simple Regression

In simple linear regression without an intercept, we are working with three main vectors, each having `n` dimensions (one for each data point):

* **`y`**: The vector of actual, observed outcome values.  
    `y = (y₁, y₂, ..., yₙ)`

* **`x`**: The vector of predictor values.  
    `x = (x₁, x₂, ..., xₙ)`

* **`ŷ`**: The vector of our model's fitted (predicted) values.  
    `ŷ = (ŷ₁, ŷ₂, ..., ŷₙ)`

Here's what we learned about their relationship:

1.  **The Predictor Vector `x` Defines a Subspace:** All possible scalar multiples of the vector `x` form a line through the origin in n-dimensional space. This line is a one-dimensional subspace. Any vector that is a prediction of our model *must* lie on this line.

2.  **The Fitted Vector `ŷ` is a Projection:** The vector of actual outcomes, `y`, is a point somewhere in that n-dimensional space, and it almost certainly does not lie on the line defined by `x`. The goal of linear regression is to find the point on that line that is **closest** to our actual `y` vector. This closest point is the **orthogonal projection** of `y` onto the line spanned by `x`. This projection is our fitted vector, `ŷ`.

3.  **`ŷ` is a Linear Combination of `y`:** As you proved with the formula for `aᵢ'`, the calculation of this projection means that our final `ŷ` vector is a linear combination (a weighted sum) of the original `y` values. The weights (`aᵢ'`) ensure that the resulting vector lies perfectly on the line defined by `x`.

4.  **`ŷ` is Collinear with `x`:** Because `ŷ` lies on the line spanned by `x`, it must be a scalar multiple of `x`. This is the geometric meaning of the first equation you started with: `ŷ = β̂x`. The coefficient `β̂` is simply the scalar that stretches or shrinks the `x` vector to become the `ŷ` vector that is closest to `y`.

In short, linear regression takes your data vector `y` and finds its "shadow" (`ŷ`) on the "line" (`x`) defined by your predictor variable. This geometric view explains *why* the model is structured the way it is and reveals the fundamental constraints on its predictions.


Yes, that is **exactly** it.

You've just connected the specific application you worked on with its general mathematical name. This is a perfect link.

Let me break down the connection between your two statements:

1.  **"The problem I worked on was data fitting to the model..."**

    This is the **problem** or the **application**. Your goal was to find the best possible `β̂` so that the model's predictions (`ŷ = β̂x`) were as close as possible to the actual data (`y`). You were "fitting" the model to the data.

2.  **"So this is least squares?"**

    This is the **method** used to solve that problem. To find the "best fit," we need a mathematical definition for "best." The least squares method defines the best fit as the one that **minimizes the sum of the squared differences** between the actual values (`yᵢ`) and the fitted values (`ŷᵢ`).

    `Minimize: Σ(yᵢ - ŷᵢ)²`


This is least squares: https://textbooks.math.gatech.edu/ila/least-squares.html

The beautiful connection that you have been exploring is this:

* The **algebraic** process of minimizing that sum of squares is perfectly equivalent to the **geometric** process of finding the orthogonal projection of the vector **y** onto the subspace spanned by the vector **x**.

The link you found discusses the general problem from the linear algebra side: how to find the "least squares solution" to an inconsistent system of equations `Ax = b` (where there's no perfect solution). Their `b` is your `y`, and their `A` is your `x`. The solution is to find the projection of `b` onto the column space of `A`.

So, you are absolutely correct. The problem you worked on was an example of data fitting, and the fundamental mathematical engine you used to solve it—whether you view it as minimizing squared errors or as projecting vectors—is called the **method of least squares**.

### The conceptual bridge (review)

### Conceptual Bridge: From a Formula to a Geometric Framework

The formula derived for $a_{i'}$ is not just an algebraic trick; it is the component-wise result of a powerful geometric process from linear algebra. This framework provides the deep intuition for the method of least squares.

We view our data as three vectors in an *n*-dimensional space ($ℝ^n$):

* **`y`**: The vector of actual, observed outcomes.
* **`x`**: The vector of predictor values.
* **`ŷ`**: The vector of our model's fitted (predicted) values.

The connection between the algebra and the geometry can be understood in these key steps:

1.  **The Predictor Vector `x` Defines a Subspace:** All possible scalar multiples of the vector `x` form a line through the origin. This line represents the entire universe of possible predictions for our model. Any valid prediction vector *must* lie on this line.

2.  **The Fitted Vector `ŷ` is a Projection:** The actual data vector `y` is a point in space that is likely not on the predictor's line. The core idea of **least squares** is to find the point on that line that is **closest** to our actual `y` vector. This closest point is the **orthogonal projection** of `y` onto the line spanned by `x`. This projection *is* our vector of fitted values, `ŷ`.

3.  **The `aᵢ'` Formula is the Projection in Action:** The formula you derived, $\hat{y}_i = \sum_{i'=1}^{n} a_{i'} y_{i'}$, shows exactly how to calculate this projection. It expresses each component of the fitted vector `ŷ` as a weighted sum (a linear combination) of the components of the original vector `y`. The weights, $a_{i'}$, are precisely structured to ensure the resulting vector `ŷ` lands perfectly on the line defined by `x`.

4.  **The Coefficient `β̂` is the Scaling Factor:** The simple model equation, `ŷ = β̂x`, confirms the geometric result. It states that the fitted vector `ŷ` is just a scaled version of the predictor vector `x` (they are collinear). The coefficient `β̂` is the specific scalar that stretches or shrinks `x` to become the correct projection.

In short, the statistical problem of **data fitting** is solved by the **method of least squares**, which is geometrically understood as the **orthogonal projection** of the outcome vector `y` onto the subspace defined by the predictor vector `x`.



Of course. This is the perfect time to consolidate everything into a structured plan.

Here is an exhaustive, long-form study guide designed for your deep-dive day. The goal is not just to understand the one problem, but to build the entire mental framework around it. This is your roadmap from the algebra you know to the geometric intuition required for machine learning.

### **A Deep Dive Study Guide: From Linear Algebra to the Geometry of Machine Learning**

You will not just know the formulas; you will understand *why* they are what they are, and you will see how this single concept forms the foundation for a huge portion of machine learning.

**Materials:**
* Your notes from our conversation.
* The textbook problem we analyzed.
* Plenty of blank paper for sketching and derivations.
* A recommended Linear Algebra resource (like Strang's or Lay's textbook/videos).
* *An Introduction to Statistical Learning (ISL)* (for the next step).

---

### **Session 1: The Foundations - Sharpening Your Linear Algebra Tools**

**Goal:** To move from a formulaic understanding of linear algebra to a deeply geometric one. Do not skip this; this is the bedrock.

#### **Topic 1.1: Vectors**
* **Conceptual Question:** What is the difference between thinking of a vector `v = (3, 4)` as a "point in space" versus an "arrow from the origin"? Why are both views useful?
* **Action Item (Sketching):** Take the two vectors from your numerical example, `x = (1, 2, 3)` and `y = (2, 3, 4)`. Sketch them in a 3D coordinate system. Get a feel for where they are relative to each other.

#### **Topic 1.2: Linear Combinations & Span**
* **Conceptual Question:** If you have one vector `x`, what is its "span"? What does the set of all vectors `c * x` (where `c` is any scalar) look like geometrically?
* **Action Item (Sketching):** On your 3D sketch, draw the line that represents the span of your vector `x`. This line is your *model subspace*. It represents every possible prediction your simple regression model is capable of making.

#### **Topic 1.3: The Dot Product**
* **Conceptual Question:** The formula is `a · b = ||a|| ||b|| cos(θ)`. Why is the dot product a measure of "alignment"? What does it mean if the dot product is large and positive? Large and negative? Exactly zero?
* **Action Item (Calculation):** Calculate the dot product of your vectors `x` and `y`. Is it positive? What does that tell you about their general alignment in the 3D space you sketched?

#### **Topic 1.4: Orthogonality**
* **Conceptual Question:** What is the geometric meaning of two vectors being orthogonal? How does this relate to their dot product? Why is this concept the key to finding the "shortest distance"?
* **Action Item (Thought Experiment):** Imagine you are standing at point `y` in your 3D space. You want to get to the "line of `x`" as quickly as possible. What angle will your path make with the line of `x`?

#### **Topic 1.5: Projections (The Master Tool)**
* **Conceptual Question:** The formula for projecting vector `y` onto vector `x` is `proj_x(y) = ((y · x) / (x · x)) * x`. Break this down. What part is the scalar (the stretching factor)? What part is the direction?
* **Action Item (Calculation & Sketching):** For your vectors `x = (1, 2, 3)` and `y = (2, 3, 4)`, calculate the projection of `y` onto `x`. Let's call this vector `ŷ`.
    * Calculate the scalar `β̂ = (y · x) / (x · x)`. Does this number look familiar? (It should be `20/14 ≈ 1.43`).
    * Calculate the full vector `ŷ = β̂ * x`.
    * Now, add the vector `ŷ` to your 3D sketch. Confirm visually that it lies perfectly on the line spanned by `x`.

---

### **Session 2: The Core Problem - Framing Regression Geometrically**

**Goal:** To translate the statistical problem of "data fitting" into the linear algebra problem of "projections."

#### **Topic 2.1: Defining the Error Vector**
* **Concept:** The "error" of our approximation is the difference between the actual data and our fitted values. In vector form, this is `e = y - ŷ`.
* **Action Item (Sketching):** On your 3D diagram, draw the error vector `e`. It should be the arrow that connects the tip of `ŷ` to the tip of `y`.

#### **Topic 2.2: The Goal of "Least Squares"**
* **Concept:** The statistical goal is to "minimize the sum of squared errors." The length (norm) of a vector is `||e|| = sqrt(e₁² + e₂² + ... + eₙ²)`. Therefore, minimizing `Σ(eᵢ)²` is the *exact same thing* as minimizing the squared length of the error vector, `||e||²`.
* **The Geometric Insight:** The shortest distance from a point (`y`) to a line (the span of `x`) is a perpendicular line. Therefore, we achieve our goal of "least squares" when the error vector `e` is **orthogonal** to the predictor vector `x`.
* **Action Item (Verification):** Look at your sketch. Does the error vector `e` appear to form a right angle with the predictor vector `x` (and the fitted vector `ŷ`)? Calculate the dot product `e · x`. It should be zero (or extremely close, allowing for rounding). This right angle is the entire secret.

---

### **Session 3: The Synthesis - Deriving Formulas from the Geometry**

**Goal:** To see how the geometric insight (`e` is orthogonal to `x`) allows us to derive all the formulas from your original problem.

#### **Topic 3.1: Deriving `β̂`**
* **Action Item (Derivation):** Write down the orthogonality condition and derive `β̂`.
    1.  Start with the geometric truth: `x · e = 0`
    2.  Substitute the definition of `e`: `x · (y - ŷ) = 0`
    3.  Substitute the model definition `ŷ = β̂x`: `x · (y - β̂x) = 0`
    4.  Distribute the dot product: `(x · y) - β̂(x · x) = 0`
    5.  Solve for `β̂`: `β̂ = (x · y) / (x · x)`
    * Look at this. You have just derived the formula for the regression coefficient from a purely geometric principle.

#### **Topic 3.2: Deriving `aᵢ'`**
* **Action Item (Derivation):** Now, derive the formula from your textbook problem.
    1.  Start with the component-wise definition of the fitted value: `ŷᵢ = (β̂) * xᵢ`
    2.  Substitute the formula for `β̂` you just derived: `ŷᵢ = [ (x · y) / (x · x) ] * xᵢ`
    3.  Write out the dot products as summations: `ŷᵢ = [ (Σᵢ' xᵢ' yᵢ') / (Σₖ xₖ²) ] * xᵢ`
    4.  Rearrange to match the target form: `ŷᵢ = Σᵢ' [ (xᵢ xᵢ') / (Σₖ xₖ²) ] * yᵢ'`
    5.  By inspection, you can now see that `aᵢ' = (xᵢ xᵢ') / (Σₖ xₖ²)`. You have just proven the problem statement from first principles.

---

### **Session 4: The Payoff - Extending the Intuition**

**Goal:** To briefly look ahead and see how this foundational understanding applies to more complex models.

* **Thought Experiment 1: Multiple Regression.** What if you have two predictor vectors, `x₁` and `x₂`? Their span is no longer a line, but a plane. Your `ŷ` vector is now the projection of `y` onto this plane. The error vector `e` must be orthogonal to the *entire plane*. What does that imply about its dot product with `x₁` and `x₂`?

* **Thought Experiment 2: PCA.** In regression, the subspace (the line of `x`) was given to you. What if it wasn't? What if you had a big cloud of data points and you wanted to find the *single best line* to project them onto, such that the projection captures the most information? That is the essence of PCA. You can see it's the same family of problems.

### **Conclusion & Next Steps**

You have now walked the entire path from a confusing set of formulas to a deep, geometric intuition. You understand what "least squares" really means, and you can see how it's just one application of the powerful concept of vector projection.

This is your new foundation. When you approach your classes, you will be able to recognize these fundamental patterns again and again.

**Your next concrete step:** Open *An Introduction to Statistical Learning* to Chapter 3 on Linear Regression. Read it with these new eyes. You will find that the concepts are no longer slippery, because you have built the solid ground to stand on.

# Regression Projection Geometry — Summary

- The 2D scatterplot of \((x, y)\) with a regression line is only a **visual simplification**.  
- The true geometry happens in **\(\mathbb{R}^n\)**, where:
  - \(y\) = vector of responses (length \(n\)).  
  - Predictors (intercept + \(x\)) span a **subspace** (a plane in simple regression).  
  - The fitted values \(\hat{y}\) are obtained by **orthogonally projecting \(y\) onto this subspace**.  

- **Why it’s hard to see in 2D:**  
  - The scatterplot is just a **shadow** of the real \(n\)-dimensional geometry.  
  - In the plot, it looks like we project onto the x-axis and then up, but that’s an illusion.  
  - In reality, regression finds the point in the predictor span (plane) closest to \(y\).  

- ✅ **Key takeaway:**  
  - The **plane** spanned by the predictors is what makes the geometry make sense.  
  - Regression = "drop a perpendicular from \(y\) to the predictor plane," giving \(\hat{y}\).  
  - This ensures \(\hat{y}\) is the closest possible approximation to the true \(y\) within the model’s universe (the sample space).  


# Why Actual y Usually Lives Outside the Predictor Universe

- The “geometric universe” = **column space of X** (all possible linear combinations of predictors).  
  - Any vector here can be perfectly represented by the model.  
  - \(\hat{y}\) lives in this universe.  

- Actual outcomes \(y\) usually **do not lie in this subspace** because:  
  - True \(y\) = signal + noise (\(y = X\beta + \epsilon\))  
  - The noise component \(\epsilon\) is generally **orthogonal** to the predictor space.  
  - This makes \(y\) “stick out” of the predictor plane into the larger space \(\mathbb{R}^n\).  

- The regression fit \(\hat{y}\) is obtained by **orthogonally projecting \(y\) onto the predictor subspace**.  
  - This gives the closest possible approximation of \(y\) **within the model’s universe**.  
  - If \(y\) already lay in the predictor space, \(\hat{y} = y\).  

- ✅ Key takeaway: \(\hat{y}\) is the best shadow of the true \(y\) in the space the model can represent, which is why we usually cannot perfectly match actual \(y\).
