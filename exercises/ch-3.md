### Conceptual 

1. 

__Describe the null hypotheses to which the p-values given in Table 3.4
correspond. Explain what conclusions you can draw based on these
p-values. Your explanation should be phrased in terms of sales, TV,
radio, and newspaper, rather than in terms of the coefficients of the
linear model.__

Intercept p-value: Very low, reject the null hypothesis that there is not a base, default amount of sales irrespective of advertising

TV p-value: Very low, reject the null hypothesis that increasing TV advertising does not lead to increase in sales

radio p-value: Very low, reject the null hyptothesis that increasing radio advertising does not lead to increase in sales

newspaper p-value: Very high, accept the null hypothesis, increasing just newspaper sales does not increase sales
