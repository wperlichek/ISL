Flexible statistical learning method: Adapts to training data closer. More subject to variance

Inflexible statistical learning method: Tries best it can to adapt to training data. More subject to bias.

Performance: If given test data it hasn't seen before, how close is this models output to the expected output?

Sample size: Count of independent data sets used in some process, like training or testing

Predictor: Like a variable or parameter. Some quality of the data that could be different among each data set in the sample.

Question: If the sample size (n) is extremely large, and the number of predictors (p) is small, which learning method will have better performance, a flexible or inflexible method?
